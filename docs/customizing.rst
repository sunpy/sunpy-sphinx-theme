Customizing the Theme
=====================

While all the default settings and styling for this theme are for the sunpy.org site, we have endeavored to make all the settings configurable.

Changing the Theme Settings
---------------------------

As well as all the default configuration settings we inherit from the pydata-sphinx-theme the sunpy-sphinx-theme provides the following configuration options.
All of these options should be set inside the ``html_theme_options`` dictionary in your ``conf.py`` file.

``footer_center``
#################

This is the path to a template or a list of templates to render in the middle segment of the footer.
It behaves the same as ``footer_start`` or ``footer_end`` from pydata-sphinx-theme.

``sst_site_root``
#################

This is the root URL for all the relative links in the top navbar when ``sst_is_root`` is `False`.
This functionality allows you to have a sphinx project where instead of linking to the absolute URL of some or all of the links in the topnav bar they are relative to that sphinx build instead.

``sst_is_root``
###############

Set this to true if you are building the project which will be deployed to ``sst_site_root``.

If this is set to `True` then this sphinx build is the root of your many-sphinx trees and links in the topnav (see below) should be relative to this site and not the ``sst_site_root`` configuration variable.

``navbar_links``
################

This is a list of tuples specifying the links to place in the top navbar.
An element of this list takes the form ``(title, document, relative_to)``.
``title`` is the text to be rendered for the link.
``document`` is a reference to a document or an absolute URL.
``relative_to`` controls how the ``document`` parameter is interpreted.

The links in ``navbar_links`` are parsed using a wrapper around sphinx's builtin `pathto <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/templating.html#pathto>`__ function.
If you want to reference things relative to the current sphinx build for every project built with the theme (i.e., they all have an about page at the site root) then you can pass ``0`` or ``1`` here to mimic the behavior of the sphinx builtin.
If you want to pass an absolute URL through set ``relative_to`` to ``3``.
If you want to pass a document which is relative to ``sst_site_root`` when ``sst_is_root`` is False and relative to the current sphinx build when it's True then set ``relative_to`` to ``2``.

It's possible to add dropdown menus to the topnav by setting document equal to a list of tuples following the same format.

``footer_links``
################

Footer links are a number of links which will get placed in the center of the footer.
They are specified in the same format as the ``navbar_links``.

Adjusting the Styling
---------------------

This theme makes some minor CSS tweaks from the pydata-sphinx-theme both to adjust the styling for SunPy's branding and to make our customisations work.
We have tried to use CSS variables to control the styling the key variables are:

.. code-block:: css

  --sst-accent-color-bright
  --sst-accent-color-muted
  --sst-dark-color
  --sst-darker-color
  --sst-darkest-color
  --sst-lightest-color
  --sst-lighter-color
  --sst-light-color
  --sst-header-background: var(--sst-dark-color);
  --sst-header-text: var(--sst-lighter-color);
  --sst-sidebar-background-color: var(--pst-color-background);

The included CSS uses "light" (light, lighter, lightest) colors for the background on the light theme and "dark" colors for the text, and the inverse on the dark theme.
The bright accent color is used for some text (e.g. links) on the dark theme, and the muted variant on the light theme to increase contrast.
